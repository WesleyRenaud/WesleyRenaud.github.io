          All in all, my first co-op work term was a success and has taught me several valuable and, as 
          I see them, universal lessons. I learned a lot of software this work term, but even more
          importantly I learned a lot about how to learn. Having to learn these pieces of software
          nearly independently, while simultaneously having to use said software in a coding project,
          required me to quickly find resources to help me learn quickly and on-the-fly.
          My experience during this work term will help guide my learning in future work terms, in the
          classroom, and beyond in my career. Furthermore, during this work term I got to learn a lot
          about myself in terms of what areas of software design interest me most, and where I may like
          to focus my learnings in future personal projects and courses I take.

          In a tech-driven world where new software is always being popularized, the most important 
          skill of a computer scientist is not per se to know specific computer languages or tools, but 
          is rather that ability to learn those or any other language, tool, or a piece of software. We 
          live in the era where it is by far the easiest to gain knowledge concerning virtually anything. 
          Now that tools/services are being developed to make that knowledge more easily found, and 
          digested, it is crucial for computer scientists to learn how to take advantage of these tools 
          in order to maximize the functionality of the knowledge they contain.
