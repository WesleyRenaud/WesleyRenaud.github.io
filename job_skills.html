          The skills I needed for this job ranged from a solid understanding of several programming 
          languages and software development tools, to time management and problem solving. 
          <br><br>
          For the technical skills that I needed, in general I learned or
          significantly developed them during my work term. I entered the term having never used Visual 
          Studio, and additionally, most of the projects I took part in required me to learn some new tool 
          or API. During my term I was able to expand my knowledge and become considerably  more 
          resourceful and independent in how I learn software. I gained comfort with using AI, forums, 
          and the documentation to teach myself whatever I had to know for a given project. 
          <br><br>
          The transferable skills I required revolve around time management, patience, resourcefulness, 
          and problem solving. I took the time management skills and deterministic attitude I had used 
          during university to motivate me to develop the skills I needed to be successful. I did 
          my best to perse vere with whatever project I was assigned, and focused on using a level-headed 
          approach. Initially I found the challenge of working with all of the new software demoralizing 
          but as I continued trying to work and expanded my knowledge, I was able to gain confidence and 
          create a better headspace with how I approach a problem. I have developed an approach 
          now emphasizing incremental development and using online examples and documentation, to one by
          one fix all issues I am having with my current project.
