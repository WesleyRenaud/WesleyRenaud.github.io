          My goals for this work term were as follows: learn more programming languages and software 
          development tools, create aesthetically pleasing and professional looking designs for all of 
          the web-based programs that I create, become more efficient in how I use my time and am able 
          to estimate how long it will take me to complete certain tasks, learn more ways to solve 
          problems that I encounter while designing software, and gain more comfortability with Visual 
          Studio and the Windows operating system.
          <br><br>
          I picked these goals to maximize the amount learned during my work term, turning me into a more 
          knowledgeable software developer, and more efficient and structured employee. These goals were 
          aimed to help me develop technical skills related to Computer Science, and transferable skills 
          which I could carry through the rest of my education and also my career. For example, by making 
          one of my goals time management and being able to estimate how long a specific task will take 
          me I would become a better communicator with my co-workers and the clients I interact with in 
          terms of our understanding of how a project is coming along. 
          <br><br>
          The technical skills which I aimed to gain/improve through my goals mostly consist of learning 
          new programming languages, operating systems, computer applications, and AI engines. I wanted 
          to focus on gaining knowledge in these areas to learn how to develop software in many more 
          contexts and environments. Developing these skills would allow me to meet many more employersâ€™ 
          expectations and prevent me from being limited to only a smaller subset of jobs because of the 
          lack of exposure I had to several common languages and software development tools. 
          <br><br>
          AI has been a focus of mine so that I could understand how it is so powerful and how it could 
          help me in my work, school, and my day-to-day life. I have learned many uses of AI engines 
          such as explaining functions of some API or language, creating unique test cases for a program, 
          and helping to design algorithms for tasks like sorting. Other tech-focused skills I wanted to 
          develop include learning C# and Visual Studio, which is an industry standard and will 
          significantly help me land future work positions, and becoming more proficient in HTML and CSS, 
          which would improve how I design and construct websites in work and in school, and potentially 
          open computer science-related opportunities outside of coding.
          <br><br>
          Some of the soft skills that I wanted to work on include becoming better at estimating how long 
          it will take me to complete a certain task, and becoming more creative with how I solve problems, 
          technical or otherwise. Becoming better with my time and understanding how much of it I need to 
          complete a given task will allow me to create more structured and balanced days in school and in 
          work. Understanding how much time I need for a certain task will allow me to allocate that time 
          over some appropriate time frame and comfortably finish it, while also giving me a clear view of 
          how much time I have to work on other things. Becoming a better problem solver for me means to 
          become more versatile in terms of the tools and resources (tech or not) that I use to overcome a 
          problem. When creating this goal I had the idea that I would adopt a logical and procedural 
          approach to dealing with a problem, carefully reviewing all details and all possible sources of 
          error. Adapting this mentality would allow me to grow more mentally resilient to these problems 
          and have a better chance of fixing them on my own, in a reasonable amount of time.
