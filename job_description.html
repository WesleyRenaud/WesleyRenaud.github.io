          My job at Armour Technology Solutions consisted of developing, maintaining and fixing bugs of 
          different pieces of software. One project may see me creating a project from scratch, giving 
          me more creative flexibility, while another may see me tack on some small piece of functionality 
          to an existing app related to some security concern or perhaps for some optimization. Sometimes
          I would work on one project over several weeks, while other times I would only work on a project
          for an hour or two.
          <br><br>
          When I was assigned some larger project to work on the process would look something like this:
          my employer would start by showing me who the project is for, and what it is meant to do. Next
          he would help me set up any VPNs or other unique services that I need for the project (i.e. SQL
          access, NAV web services, etc.). I then be given some time to either complete the project, or
          complete some portion or version of it. I would then present my project to the customer and
          then make any revisions which they request or finish the project if it was not yet complete
          ahead of the meeting. Some of the larger projects may see me develop a version of the project 
          which has me access the data required statically, only to change it to get the data dynamically 
          later to make the process of writing the logic of the program easier.
          <br><br>
          Some of the projects I worked on included an email sorting program, a floor plan proposal 
          maker, a customer portal login system, a drive distance calculator tool, and various tools used 
          to read data from some file and insert that data into an SQL database.
