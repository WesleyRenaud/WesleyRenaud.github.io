            I believe I have been able to at least make some progress towards completing each of the 
            five goals I set out at the beginning of the semester, although some of these goals consist 
            of skills which I will continue to develop over time.
            <br><br>
            For the first goal, which was to learn more programming languages and software development 
            tools, I spent a lot of the term working on a project which either saw me using a new 
            language, or at the least some new API or web service. Most of my software projects had me 
            using C# and Visual Studio neither of which I had used prior to this work term. Some of the 
            other APIs and tools I used include Telerik, Microsoft Graph, Azure Maps, and Postman. By 
            using these tools I was able to gain more of an understanding of what these tools do, in 
            general how APIs are used and what services they can provide. From using these APIs during my 
            work term, I will now be more easily able to findand make use of other APIs and tools in my 
            own programming projects.
            <br><br>
            My second goal was to learn how to create more aesthetically pleasing and professional looking
            web interfaces. For this goal I was able to put into practice what I had already learned about
            HTML, CSS, and web design from school. I focused on learning about more HTML and CSS code, and 
            separate tools or APIs to not only make my applications more visually appealing, but also more 
            functional and intuitive to use. One of these tools was Telerik which allowed me to store data 
            in grids with built-in features such as filtering, sorting, and grouping. I also learned many 
            more CSS styling and some new HTML tags. While I definitely made some progress towards his 
            goal, I still want to learn a lot more website creation/designing tools; this will likely be 
            a focus in future school and personal projects which I take on. 
            <br><br>
            The next goal I had was to improve my time management skills and become better at being able 
            to predict how long it will take for me to complete a certain task. In general this goal 
            challenged me this work term since as I was completing projects I was, a lot of the time, 
            learning how to use the technology too. I often encountered snags which would slow progress 
            down to a halt. As I became more familiar with the tools I was using I got a better 
            understanding of how quickly I could work, although this skill is definitely one I want to 
            continue to work on as I become more proficient in troubleshooting and bug-fixing. Thinking
            about this goal has required me to reflect on what it's like sometimes to work a job with set
            start and end times as opposed to being able to work whenever you want and only for how long 
            you have to work during school. I've had to start thinking about how to structure my day 
            around my working hours, but also when other people will need to talk with me.
            <br><br>
            My second-to-last goal was to learn more ways to problem solve, and find bugs. While I 
            recognize I still have a lot to learn here, I believe that I was able to learn a lot 
            concerning this issue during my work term. For one I became very comfortable with using Visual 
            Studio’s debugging features and error-detecting system. I also gained a lot of comfortability 
            with using AI in certain situations to teach me what the tech I’d be using could and couldn’t 
            do, and why I may be getting certain syntax errors. I also learned about situations where AI 
            should not be used. Becoming a better problem solver when programming has helped me develop
            more general problem solving skills in terms of how to be more resourceful and methodical when
            finding and searching resources online.
            <br><br>
            My final goal for my first work term was to gain more comfortability with Visual Studio and 
            the Windows Operating system. I would consider the first part of that goal very successful; 
            I fully understand and embrace the powerfulness of a tool like Visual Studio. I have become 
            comfortable with creating, developing and debugging projects. I also gained a level of 
            proficiency in C# similar to that of programming languages I have spent several years with 
            such as Java and C. The second part of that goal, gaining familiarity with the Windows OS, 
            was, in general, successful. I am now familiar enough with Windows to where the fact that I 
            am using a Windows computer, as opposed to one with an OS I would be more familiar with, like 
            Mac, in general it does not affect my ability to work. Additionally, due to some of the 
            software that I used during my term, I gained some experience using the tools/apps associated 
            with the Windows operating system like the command line window. If I was working with a 
            Windows computer and encountered some problem that required me to change some setting within 
            the operating system, I believe I would have a good chance of being able to fix the issue. 
            Taking a heads-on approach to learning C# and Visual Studio has taught  me about a lot of 
            resources and techniques which can be used to efficiently learn a new language.
